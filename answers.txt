//examples use pseudo code

1. Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.

   If one of the operands is a string, Java Script treats the "+" operator as a concatination 
   operator, instead of an an arithmetic operator. JavaScript automatically converts the number 
   into a string to perform the operation, ensuring everything is the same type.

2. Name a scenario where using the == operator could cause a bug.

let userInput  "0" // A string input from the user
let isZero  userInput == 0  // close comparison

if isZero 
  console.log "The input is zero!"  // This will run
   else 
  console.log "The input is NOT zero!"


3. Name the operator(s) that you find confusing and explain why.
  
  I'd say they don't "confuse" me exactly, I'd say I'm still learning them and how to use them.

4. Explain a situation where you would use the Modulus operator and why.

   One of the basic ways to use modulus (%) is with floating-point numbers.
   Such as: 
   let result  10.5 % 3; 
   console.log result  // Output: 1.5
